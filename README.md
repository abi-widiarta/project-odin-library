# The Odin Project | Library

What I Learned :
- Local Storage
- Creating custom modal with tailwind
- Pointer events none
- using multiple transfrom with css to make switch animation (has to be in different element, parent and child)

Notes for this project :
- Responsive
- The UI can still be improved a lot, by changing text size on various device resolution, case when the input text is long
